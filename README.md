# PDFQueryBot
PDFQueryBot is a fully local backend system that lets users ask questions about PDF documents and get answers strictly grounded in the document content. It uses text extraction, chunking, vector embeddings, semantic search, and a local LLM to ensure accurate, source-bound responses with no external knowledge.
